Primary Objective:
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of specific supermarkets.
Compare product prices and availability across different stores.
Identify trends and patterns in product offerings and pricing strategies.

Challenges:
Accessing Mercadona's API: Due to lack of documentation, direct API access was not possible.
Data Acquisition: Web scraping was used to gather data from Dia's website, which employs anti-scraping measures.
Data Integration and Standardization: Products and categories were standardized for accurate comparison across stores.
Price Updates: Some product prices changed during the analysis period, requiring additional analysis.

Analysis Conducted:
Shopping Basket Analysis: 9 basic household products were analyzed in detail, comparing prices and providing summaries.
Expensive Items: The most expensive items were identified and categorized.
Product Availability and Categories: The number of products offered in different categories was analyzed.
Price Changes in Mercadona: Products with price changes during the analysis period were identified and further investigated.

Outcomes:
